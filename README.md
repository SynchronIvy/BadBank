# **Bad Bank**  

# **Description**: 

This project is a work-in-progess example of a banking application. Right now, it is a front-end only app with no security, authentication, or authorization. Its primary purpose is to help me learn to code. I am building it as part of my learning-process and in order to finish coding bootcamp I'm enrolled in with MITxPRO.

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To install and run this project, clone this repository and download the files. In terminal, you can run a local version by dragging a copy of the index.html files into your browser. Or, you can run it using a local server by using the command node index.js in your command line. 

# **Bad Bank in Action**: 

I will add screenshots and gifs of the project in action here. 

# **Technology used and Dependencies**: 

This version requires no dependencies, but when I incorporate the back-end, it will require CORS, Express, and Mongo.

# **Features**: 

In the near future I will add back-end functionality to this project.

# **Support**:
